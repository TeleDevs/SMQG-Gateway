# android-mqtt-quickstart [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bytehala/android-mqtt-quickstart.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bytehala/android-mqtt-quickstart)
Android Studio port of the Eclipse paho MQTT sample project.

## Environment Tested On
1. OpenJDK Java 11 by Amazon (sdkman 11.0.6-amzn)
2. Pixel XL API 29 emulator
3. Android Studio 3.6.2

I am maintaining this on my own, and as such am unable to test on multiple devices and environments.

You can support me buy contributing code, filing bugs, asking/answering questions, or buying me a coffee.

## Getting Started
1. Download the code `git clone http://www.github.com/bytehala/android-mqtt-quickstart`
2. Open the project in Android Studio
3. Build and run it.

## Using the Sample App
To test the app, you need an MQTT broker. Luckily, HiveMQ provides a free one which we can use for testing.

After successfully connecting, you can start subscribing and publishing to topics using the app.

## More About MQTT
MQTT is a messaging protocol which has applications in the Internet of Things (IoT).
This sample project uses Eclipse's open-source implementation called the Paho Project.
If you go to the [original source](https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.java) where I lifted this project from, there are non-Android sample projects that use the Paho library.

This youtube video explains the MQTT for IoT at a very basic level.

## Create Your Own App
All you need is an MQTT broker.  
This app is just piggybacking on HiveMQ's free broker.

Take note of the dependencies in this project.
`org.eclipse.paho.android.service` and `org.eclipse.paho.client.mqttv3` depend on the old android-support-v4, specifically the LocalBroadcastManager class.

Maybe we can migrate to mqttv5 using the plain Java library at https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.java

The eclipse sources can be found at:
https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.android

Honestly, when I made an MQTT app for a client, I just built on top of this sample project.

# Word of Warning
This app was made in 2015-2016, and is a demo of how to use the Eclipse MQTT Libraries, not how to code in Android.

Architecture components are a thing now, and I strongly advise the use of ViewModel and LifecycleHook.

# Work In Progress
Definitely look at the "jetpacknav" branch which aims to transform everything into a Single-Activity application, which has been the Android recommendation since 2018. It's currently a work in progress but a clear example of how to transform legacy apps from the old Android paradigm (multiple-Activity) to the newer ones (single-Activity Jetpack).

# MQTT V3 vs V5
This project uses MQTT v3 and I will be looking into using v3 and v5 in the near future.
